# Track line-level changes to your PHP deployment-artifacts.

WerkTool is a Composer plugin that helps you move code from your development builds into diverse deployment-artifacts. The deployment-artifact targets are specified by their function (ex: dev, int, stage, prod) and hosting platform (ex: local, linode, aws, rackspace).
